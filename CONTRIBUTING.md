## 1. Bug reports

We use GitHub issues for bug tracking.

First, check if your bug has been reported already. If not, open a new GitHub
issue. Make sure to include the following:

- Steps to reproduce
- Actual outcome
- Expected outcome
- How you're accessing Cloogle (through the frontend or directly to Clean)

**If you have found a security vulnerability**, please do **not** open a GitHub
issue. Instead, contact one of the maintainers (see the list in `README.md`).
We will take immediate action.

## 2. Submitting patches

### General

- Fork the repo, make a topic branch and when done submit a pull request
- If your PR fixes some issue, be sure to mention it in the commit message
  (e.g. `Fix #15`)
- Keep PRs as focused as possible. If you intend to fix multiple, independent
  things, open multiple, separate PRs.
- If you intend to make large changes, it's probably best to open an issue and
  discuss with the maintainers first.
- If necessary, edit `README.md` as well.

### Code style

- Use tabs instead of spaces
- Keep lines under 80 chars (except for HTML).
- When editing the frontend, do not use external frameworks (jQuery,
  bootstrap, etc.). We strive for minimality and elegance.

### Other stuff

- Add yourself to the authors list in `README.md`
